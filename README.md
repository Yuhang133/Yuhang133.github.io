## Differences between algorithms and models
**Algorithms:** A step-by-step **computational procedure** or **set of rules** designed to perform specific tasks, such as data processing, optimization, or analysis. 

**Models:** A **mathematical or probabilistic framework** that represents relationships in data, often used for prediction, classification, or understanding biological systems.

The differences between algorithms and models can be summarized as table below.

| Dimension       | Algorithm                          | Model                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Focus**        | *How* to execute tasks             | *What* the data represents         |
| **Form**         | Concrete steps (e.g., sorting, aligning)     | Mathematical framework (e.g., neural networks) |
| **Dependency**   | Standalone or used to build models | Relies on algorithms for training  |
| **Example**      | `DEGseq2` analyzes RNA data  | Neuron network for deep learning |

## Plan of learning bioinfomatics
### 1. Master Linux System and R Programming Basics
Build foundational programming skills for bioinformatics workflows. Get familiar with terminal fundamentals (text processing and process control), environment Configuration (conda environment management) and shell scripting. Be acquainted with R packages such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr` and `DEseq2`.
### 2. Reinforce Knowledge with Assignments and Learning Materials
Utilize afterclass assignments and learning materials provided to solidify understanding.
### 3. Share Knowledge and Experience with Peers
Share programming experience and troubleshooting tips for Linux/R systems. 
### 4. Apply Bioinformatics to Lab Data Analysis
Translate skills to real-world research. In my own research project, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms of biological phenomena, and bioinfomatis can be applied to analyze **Differential gene expression** and **ATAC-seq peak calling**.
